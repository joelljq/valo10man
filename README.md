# valo10man

Inspired by one of the Valorant's influencer called "Tarik" with his Pro City 10 Man Discord server, I took the challenge to create something similar for my own Discord server where the bot has the following functions:
1. Queue system
2. MMR system
3. Matchmaking based on MMR
4. Randomizing of Map choice
5. Allocating of points after match results
6. MMR system leaderboard
